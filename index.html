            <div class="bar"></div>
            <p class="desc">Fabulous. Unlike other rythm games, DJMAX provides way to the common contribution of man to music. When you play the game, you are making your own music. Don’t believe this? Go to any gameplay video, and you’ll mostly find people tapping according to the music, and if they do fail in syncing to the beat, the music goes way off. You’ll feel the need to improve your rhythm, and get better fast that way. I was never the greatest fan of OSU!Mania, since it is just way too difficult, challenging and non-sync to the music. But that’s how it’d feel when you play on insane difficulties. </p>

            <p class="desc">DJMAX provides you with options, from 4 to 8 keys of gameplay. You tap the keys to their custom-production made maps, which can be described as just, Elegant. You can keep your combo from breaking by playing maps on full-combo, and not exiting a map while you’re just playing. I’ve seen people keep their combo to like, 100k and stuff. There is also a lot of modes available, including Competitve (Self-Explanatory) and AIR mode,<span id = "artists"></span> where you get to interact with the audience, and your messages display on the layout for a time.</p>

            <p class="desc">DJMAX Respect has a load of artists, most of them being famous Korean artists. and other DJs as well. When I started the game, I wasn’t able to find much of the artist’s information while playing, but the songs were so good, that it interested me in checking out the artists who make such great music. To be fair, most of the Artists are repeated composers of music for DJMAX, which gives it an exclusive feel. Here are my favourite artists from the game.</p>
